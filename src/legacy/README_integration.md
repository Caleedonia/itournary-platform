# Sanity and MongoDB Integration - Code Update and Next Steps

Hello! We've successfully integrated the Sanity.io CMS and MongoDB Atlas database into your "iTournary" Next.js application. This is a significant step towards making your platform dynamic and data-driven.

## Summary of Work Completed:

1.  **Environment Setup:** You have successfully configured your `.env.local` file with the necessary Sanity and MongoDB credentials and installed the required `npm` packages (`@sanity/client`, `mongoose`).
2.  **Sanity.io Client:** A client module (`src/lib/sanityClient.ts`) has been created to connect to your Sanity project and fetch content. This client uses the environment variables you set up.
3.  **MongoDB Client (Mongoose):** A connection module (`src/lib/mongodb.ts`) using Mongoose has been established to connect to your MongoDB Atlas cluster. This also uses the environment variables.
4.  **Dynamic Resorts Page:** The `/resorts` page (`src/app/(main)/resorts/page.tsx`) has been updated to dynamically fetch and display resort data directly from your Sanity Studio. It includes image handling and links to individual resort pages (which will be the next step to make dynamic).
5.  **MongoDB User Model:** A basic Mongoose model for Users (`src/models/User.ts`) has been created, based on our earlier schema design. This will store user-specific data.
6.  **Users API Endpoint:** A Next.js API route (`src/app/api/users/route.ts`) has been set up. This endpoint currently supports:
    *   `GET /api/users`: Fetches all users (for testing/admin purposes).
    *   `POST /api/users`: Creates a new user or returns an existing user if the email is already present.

## Files Provided:

**Action for your team:** Please commit these changes to your "iTournary" GitHub repository.

## Next Steps & Testing:

1.  **Populate Sanity Studio with Resort Data:**
    *   Go to your Sanity Studio: `https://itournary-studio.sanity.studio/`
    *   Create a few "Resort" entries. Ensure you fill in at least the `Name`, `Slug` (e.g., "my-awesome-resort"), `Main Image`, and `Brief Description` fields for each resort. The `slug` will be used in the URL.
    *   Once you publish these entries, the `/resorts` page on your local development server (`http://localhost:3000/resorts`) should display them dynamically.

2.  **Test the Users API Endpoint (`/api/users`):
    *   You can use a tool like Postman or Insomnia to test this.
    *   **POST Request to `http://localhost:3000/api/users`**:
        *   Set the method to `POST`.
        *   Set the body to `JSON` and provide content like: `{"email": "testuser@example.com", "name": "Test User"}`
        *   You should receive a success response with the created or existing user data.
    *   **GET Request to `http://localhost:3000/api/users`**:
        *   Set the method to `GET`.
        *   You should receive a list of all users created.

3.  **Further Development Priorities (To be discussed):**
    *   Making the individual resort detail pages (`/resorts/[resortId]`) dynamic by fetching full resort details from Sanity.
    *   Implementing other dynamic content pages based on your Sanity schemas (Services, Destinations, etc.).
    *   Integrating the User model with NextAuth for persistent user sessions and profile management.
    *   Building out the booking functionality using MongoDB.

I am ready to proceed with the next set of development tasks based on your priorities. Please let me know if you encounter any issues with these updates or if you have any questions!
