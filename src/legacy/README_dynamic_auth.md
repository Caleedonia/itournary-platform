# Dynamic Content & Auth Integration - Code Update and Next Steps

Hello! We've made significant progress on the "iTournary" project by implementing dynamic content pages and integrating NextAuth with MongoDB for robust user authentication.

## Summary of Recent Work Completed:

1.  **Dynamic Resort Detail Pages (`/resorts/[resortId]`):**
    *   These pages now fetch and display detailed information for individual resorts directly from your Sanity Studio, including descriptions, amenities, media galleries, room types, and more, based on the `resortId` (slug) in the URL.

2.  **Dynamic Service Listing Page (`/services`):**
    *   This page dynamically lists all available services, fetching data like name, brief description, and main image from Sanity.

3.  **Dynamic Service Detail Pages (`/services/[serviceId]`):**
    *   Similar to resort details, these pages now show comprehensive information for individual services (description, pricing, duration, gallery, etc.) fetched from Sanity based on the `serviceId` (slug).

4.  **Enhanced User Authentication (NextAuth + MongoDB):
    *   The User model (`src/models/User.ts`) has been updated to support password hashing and roles.
    *   The NextAuth API route (`src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`) now uses your MongoDB Atlas database for user authentication and session management, replacing the previous mock user store. This allows for persistent user accounts.

## Crucial Next Step: Content Population & Validation

To fully test and validate these new dynamic pages and the authentication system, it is **essential to populate your Sanity Studio with relevant content**:

1.  **Resorts:**
    *   Go to your Sanity Studio: `https://itournary-studio.sanity.studio/`
    *   Ensure you have several "Resort" entries with all fields filled out, especially:
        *   `Name`, `Slug` (e.g., "tropical-escape-villa"), `Description` (use the rich text editor), `Brief Description`, `Main Image`, `Gallery Images`, `Location` details, `Amenities`, `Room Types`, `Wedding Capabilities` (if applicable), etc.
    *   The `/resorts` and `/resorts/[your-resort-slug]` pages should now reflect this content.

2.  **Services:**
    *   Similarly, create several "Service" entries in Sanity Studio.
    *   Fill in fields like `Name`, `Slug`, `Description`, `Brief Description`, `Main Image`, `Gallery`, `Category`, `Price`, `Duration`, etc.
    *   The `/services` and `/services/[your-service-slug]` pages will then display this data.

3.  **User Account Testing (Credentials):**
    *   **Registration:** Since we are using credentials provider, new users would typically be created via a registration form that calls our `/api/users` POST endpoint (or a dedicated registration API endpoint we can build next). For now, you can manually create a user in your MongoDB Atlas `users` collection or use the `/api/users` POST endpoint with a tool like Postman to create a test user with a hashed password.
        *   Example for `/api/users` POST: `{"email": "test@example.com", "name": "Test User", "password": "testpassword123", "role": "member"}` (The password will be hashed by the User model pre-save hook).
    *   **Login:** Navigate to `/account` (or your sign-in page). Try logging in with the credentials of a user you created in MongoDB.

Once you have populated some content and tested the login, please let me know how it goes. This will allow us to proceed with further feature development and refinement.

I am ready for your feedback and to move on to the next tasks once you've had a chance to add content and test these updates.
