# Favorites Feature - Update & Validation Guide

Hello! We have now implemented the **Favorites Feature**, allowing users to mark resorts and (eventually) services as their favorites and view them on their account page.

## Summary of Features Implemented:

1.  **User Schema Update (`src/models/User.ts`):
    *   The MongoDB `User` schema has been updated to include `favoriteResorts` and `favoriteServices` fields, which will store arrays of ObjectIds referencing the respective items.

2.  **Favorites API Endpoints (`src/app/api/users/favorites/route.ts`):
    *   **GET `/api/users/favorites`**: Fetches the current logged-in user’s favorited resorts and services (populates names and slugs for display).
    *   **POST `/api/users/favorites`**: Allows adding or removing an item (resort or service) from the user’s favorites. Requires `itemId`, `itemType` ("resort" or "service"), and `action` ("add" or "remove").

3.  **Favorite Button Component (`src/components/FavoriteButton.tsx`):
    *   A reusable React component that displays a heart icon.
    *   Allows users to toggle the favorite status of an item.
    *   Handles API calls to add/remove favorites and updates its state optimistically/reactively.
    *   Requires `itemId`, `itemType`, and `initialIsFavorited` props.

4.  **Integration into Resort Detail Page (`src/app/(main)/resorts/[resortId]/page.tsx`):
    *   The resort detail page is now a client component (`"use client";`) to manage user-specific favorite status.
    *   It fetches the resort details and then fetches the current user’s favorites to determine if the displayed resort is already favorited.
    *   A `FavoriteButton` is displayed near the resort title, allowing users to add/remove the resort from their favorites.

5.  **Display Favorites on Account Page (`src/app/(main)/account/page.tsx`):
    *   The "My Account" page now fetches and displays lists of the user’s favorited resorts and services.
    *   Links are provided to navigate directly to the detail pages of these favorited items.

## Validation Steps for Your Team:

To ensure everything is working as expected, please test the following flows thoroughly:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Ensure you have at least one user account created and can log in.
    *   Ensure you have some resorts (and ideally services, though the button isn't on service pages yet) populated in your Sanity Studio.

2.  **Test Adding/Removing Favorites from Resort Detail Page:**
    *   Log in to your iTournary application.
    *   Navigate to a resort detail page (e.g., `/resorts/your-resort-slug`).
    *   You should see a heart icon (the `FavoriteButton`) near the resort title.
    *   **Initial State:** If the resort is not favorited, the heart should be an outline.
    *   **Add to Favorites:** Click the heart icon. It should fill in (e.g., turn red), indicating it has been added to favorites. The action should be quick.
    *   **Verify API Call (Optional):** Open your browser’s developer console (Network tab) and your Next.js server console. When you click, you should see a POST request to `/api/users/favorites` with `action: "add"`.
    *   **Remove from Favorites:** Click the filled heart icon again. It should revert to an outline, indicating removal. 
    *   **Verify API Call (Optional):** You should see another POST request to `/api/users/favorites` with `action: "remove"`.
    *   Test this on multiple resorts.

3.  **Test Favorites Display on Account Page:**
    *   After favoriting a few resorts, navigate to your "My Account" page (`/account`).
    *   Under the "My Favorites" section, you should see a list of "Favorite Resorts."
    *   Verify that all resorts you favorited on the detail pages appear in this list.
    *   Verify that the names are correct and the links navigate to the correct resort detail pages.
    *   If you unfavorite a resort from its detail page and refresh the account page (or revisit it), it should no longer appear in the favorites list.

4.  **Test Behavior for Logged-Out Users:**
    *   Log out of your account.
    *   Navigate to a resort detail page. The `FavoriteButton` might still be visible but should be disabled or prompt for login upon clicking (current implementation shows it, but clicking prompts an alert to log in).
    *   Verify that you cannot add items to favorites when logged out.

5.  **Test with Multiple Users (If Possible):**
    *   If you have multiple test user accounts, log in as a different user and verify that their favorites are separate and do not interfere with the first user’s favorites.

Your feedback after performing these validation steps is crucial. Please let me know if you encounter any issues or if the feature works as expected.

Once you confirm these features are satisfactory, we will proceed to the next planned feature: **Basic Itinerary Planning for Individual Users**.
