# User Account Features - Code Update and Validation Guide

Hello! We have now completed the implementation of the core User Account Enhancement features for your "iTournary" project. This includes user registration, login, profile viewing/editing, a full password management flow (forgot/reset), and route protection for account-specific pages.

## Summary of Features Implemented:

1.  **User Profile Page (`/account`):
    *   Displays logged-in user information (name, email, role).
    *   Provides a link to edit the profile.
    *   Includes a sign-out button.
    *   If not logged in, this page serves as the Sign-In page.

2.  **Edit Profile Page (`/account/edit-profile`):
    *   Allows logged-in users to update their name.
    *   Email is displayed but not editable for now.
    *   Backend API (`/api/users/update-profile`) handles the update securely.

3.  **Registration Form (`/register`):
    *   Allows new users to sign up by providing their name, email, and password.
    *   Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in MongoDB.
    *   Uses the `/api/users` POST endpoint for account creation.

4.  **Password Management:**
    *   **Forgot Password Page (`/forgot-password`):** Users can enter their email to request a password reset link.
    *   **Forgot Password API (`/api/auth/forgot-password`):** Generates a secure, unique reset token, stores its hash and expiry in the User model, and (placeholder) sends an email with the reset link. *Currently, the reset link is logged to the server console for testing purposes since a live email service is not yet configured.*
    *   **Reset Password Page (`/reset-password/[token]`):** Users can enter and confirm their new password after clicking the link from the (simulated) email.
    *   **Reset Password API (`/api/auth/reset-password`):** Validates the token, updates the user's password securely, and invalidates the token.

5.  **Route Protection (Middleware - `src/middleware.ts`):
    *   The `/account` and `/account/edit-profile` pages are now protected. Users will be redirected to the sign-in page if they try to access these routes without being authenticated.
    *   General site browsing (e.g., resorts, services, homepage) remains accessible to unauthenticated users as requested.

## Validation Steps for Your Team:

To ensure everything is working as expected, please test the following flows thoroughly:

1.  **Registration:**
    *   Navigate to `/register`.
    *   Fill out the form with new user details and submit.
    *   Verify success/error messages.
    *   Check your MongoDB Atlas `users` collection to see if the new user was created with a hashed password and the role "member".

2.  **Login & Logout:**
    *   Navigate to `/account` (or be redirected if trying a protected route).
    *   Log in with the credentials of the user you just registered (or a previously created test user).
    *   Verify successful login and redirection to the account page, displaying user information.
    *   Click "Sign Out" and verify you are logged out and redirected (e.g., to the homepage).

3.  **Profile Viewing & Editing:**
    *   Log in.
    *   On the `/account` page, verify your name and email are displayed.
    *   Click the "Edit Profile" link.
    *   On the `/account/edit-profile` page, change your name and save.
    *   Verify the success message and that your name is updated on the `/account` page and in the session (e.g., welcome message).
    *   Check MongoDB to confirm the name change.

4.  **Password Reset Flow:**
    *   Log out if you are logged in.
    *   Navigate to `/forgot-password`.
    *   Enter the email address of a registered user.
    *   Submit the form. You should see a confirmation message.
    *   **Check your server console output.** Since we don't have a live email service, the password reset link (containing the token) will be logged there. It will look something like `http://localhost:3000/reset-password/YOUR_UNIQUE_TOKEN`.
    *   Copy this full URL and paste it into your browser.
    *   On the `/reset-password/[token]` page, enter a new password and confirm it.
    *   Submit the form.
    *   Verify the success message.
    *   Try logging in with the new password on the `/account` page.
    *   Check MongoDB: the `resetPasswordToken` and `resetPasswordExpires` fields for that user should now be cleared, and the `password` field should be updated (with a new hash).

5.  **Route Protection:**
    *   Log out.
    *   Try to directly access `/account` or `/account/edit-profile`.
You should be redirected to the sign-in page (which is `/account` when not logged in).
    *   After logging in, verify you can access these pages.
    *   Ensure you can still access public pages like `/resorts`, `/services`, and the homepage without being logged in.

Your feedback after performing these validation steps will be invaluable. Please let me know if you encounter any issues or have any questions.

Once you confirm these features are working to your satisfaction, we can discuss the next set of priorities for the "iTournary" project!
