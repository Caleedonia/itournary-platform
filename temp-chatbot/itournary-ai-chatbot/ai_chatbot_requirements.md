# iTournary AI Chatbot Requirements

## Overview
The iTournary platform requires an AI-powered conversational component that guides users through building their travel itineraries through natural dialogue. This chatbot will replace or complement the existing wizard-based approach with a more engaging, conversational experience.

## Core Requirements

### Conversational Itinerary Building
- Engage users in natural conversation to collect travel preferences
- Ask contextual questions about trip details (guests, dates, destinations, activities)
- Provide real-time insights during conversation (weather predictions, seasonal information)
- Build complete itineraries based on conversation outcomes
- Present structured itineraries for further customization

### User Experience Flow
1. User initiates conversation with the AI chatbot
2. Chatbot asks foundational questions (number of guests, dates, etc.)
3. Chatbot provides contextual feedback (e.g., "at the dates you've provided you can likely expect sunshine and 10% likelihood of rain")
4. Conversation continues until sufficient information is gathered
5. Chatbot generates a complete itinerary based on the conversation
6. User is presented with an editable itinerary page
7. User can customize by selecting different vendors, adding/removing activities, etc.

### Technical Requirements
- Natural language processing capabilities
- Context retention throughout the conversation
- Integration with weather and seasonal data
- Vendor and activity recommendation system
- Itinerary generation and formatting
- Seamless transition from conversation to structured itinerary
- Editing capabilities for the generated itinerary

### Integration Points
- Must integrate with existing iTournary platform architecture
- Should connect with vendor database for recommendations
- Must feed into the itinerary management system
- Should leverage existing user profiles and preferences

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully build complete itineraries through conversation alone
- Chatbot provides valuable contextual insights during planning
- Generated itineraries are comprehensive and well-structured
- Users can easily customize their itineraries after generation
- The experience feels natural, helpful, and more engaging than a traditional form-based approach
